== Description ==
Want users to create courses without providing them back-end access? We’ve got a solution for you! With the Front-end Course Creation Plugin, you can create a ‘Course Author’ user with special privileges. A Course Author can create and manage courses, lessons, topics and quizzes, right from the front-end!
